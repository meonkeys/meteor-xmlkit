node_xslt and libxmljs packaged for Meteor
==========================================

Usage
-----

Package exposes two objects: XSLT (node_xslt) and XML (libxmljs) - server side only (of course).

Effect is the same as you did:

```
XSLT = npm.require("libxmljs");
XML = npm.require("node_xslt");
```

(You don't need to include any npm packages, just use XSLT and XML objects in your program)
